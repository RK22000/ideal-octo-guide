I dual booted my windows machine with Pop!OS today to try out 
[ZED](https://zed.dev/). While I had this I also fell in the rabbit hole of
trying to enable the finger print reader for authentication. As I understood it
from a little quacking around online, all I needed was `fprintd` and 
`libpam-fprintd`. Unfortunately my fingerprint reader is not included in the 
[list of suported devices](https://fprint.freedesktop.org/supported-devices.html).
However thanks to the [Synaptics Tudor Driver Relinking Project](https://github.com/Popax21/synaTudor)
my fingerprint scanner could be made to work with libfprint. Thanks Popax21 and
everyone wo contributed to the project. Also thanks _u/16mhz_ for makeing the 
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/10xzlxo/using_synaptics_06cb00be_fingerprint_with/?rdt=40038)
highlighting the project




Thing to note. While I'm able to log in using fingerprint, the fingerprint 
login does not unlock the keychain in which my broswer stored its saved 
passwords. So I still need to type out the password after unlocking
